This chatbot, which will soon need a *name*, will take on more capabilities and an aptitude to converse. How will I do this? My chatbot will have a *Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing* internally.

Deep Learning architecture and its organic algorithms greatly advance the language process. To keep this on a familiar level, this means deep learning attempts to understand and more naturally respond to better results.

Without going to far into the technical whitepapers in this discussion, my chatbot project was built in *Python* with *TensorFlow* and uses â€œ[cornell movie dialogs corpus](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/Cornell_Movie-Dialogs_Corpus.html)."
