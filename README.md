Portfolio to showcase various methods and ideas in machine learning and projects. More discussion found on my [blog](https://jeremywood.ai).

Originally, **my portfolio** was based on the [\*folio theme](https://github.com/bogoli/-folio) (published by [Lia Bogoev](http://liabogoev.com) and under the MIT license).

Since then, a full style re-write and additional features.

<!-- Check out creating a theme demo -->

## Getting started

The first area icon hosts data preprocssing templates that will set up the rest of the more complex models found in [Portfolio 1](/_projects/1-Project.md).

## Features in Portfolio

#### Code Highlighting

This theme implements Jekyll's built in code syntax highlighting with Rouge.

## Contributing
