Artificial Intelligence Explorer and Deep Learning Practitioner. It has been my passion to dive into AI’s realms of science and data analysis.

After completing my Bachelor’s of Arts in Communications with an emphasis in Artificial Intelligence and Cyber Security, I found my inspiration. Could I understand how a machine learns to allow it to communicate better with me or have better information?

**Quickly,** I found the information overwhelming with the vast number of papers, blogs, and online courses. With this trove, I reached out to online instructors, lead bloggers in the community and began to seek out books to help me.

I see how much Artificial Intelligence can advance and change. I strive to share what I learned through this exploration. 

### Passionate Explorer

I will not proclaim to be the premier in *‘all things AI.’* To be fair, some of the math can simply blow one’s mind.

I read blogs and websites and believe there is an opportunity to start more conversations about Artificial Intelligence and its development.

### Hands-On Projects, Sharing Experiences

I learn better through doing, breaking, dissecting and improving a process. At times, I find that ‘just the right tool’ to discover a solution.

As a developer and hacker of code, I stay up-to-date on techniques, programming languages and application. Direct and smaller projects help teach myself applied AI and machine learning.

I hope to share my steps, overcoming tasks and updating projects.
